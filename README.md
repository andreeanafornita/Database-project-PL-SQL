Welcome to the University Database Management System project! :books:

## Project Overview :clipboard:

The goal of this project is to design a comprehensive database using SQL Oracle Developer, specifically tailored for efficiently managing data related to various universities in Bucharest. üè´ This project encompasses a range of interconnected tables that provide insights into relationships between institutions, employees, and students.

With this database, we'll uncover which universities are sponsored by prominent companies like Vodafone, Orange, and Accenture. Furthermore, we'll delve into intricate details about different students and their respective teachers.

## Main Tables :file_folder:

To ensure clarity and effectiveness, I've structured the project with 5 primary tables:
- Sponsors
- Teachers
- Universities
- Gradebook
- Students

These tables form the cornerstone of our database, capturing essential information related to universities and their academic ecosystem. üìä

## Complex Relationships :couple_with_heart:

Considering that many relationships are "many-to-many," I've devised intermediary tables that bridge between at least 2 primary tables. These intermediary tables serve as vital connectors and are aptly named by combining the two tables they relate to. This design simplifies their recognition and usage. :link:

## Getting Started :rocket:

To explore this project:
1. **Clone the Repository**: Start by cloning this repository to your local machine.
2. **Setup Database Environment**: Configure your SQL Oracle Developer environment to interact with the database.
3. **Explore the Tables**: Dive into the distinct tables and relationships to get a comprehensive understanding.
4. **Discover Insights**: Query and explore the database to extract valuable insights about universities and their dynamics.

## Contribution :raised_hands:

Feel free to contribute to this project by suggesting improvements, proposing new features, or reporting issues. Together, we can enhance the utility and value of this database management system. :bulb:

## Acknowledgments :clap:

A big shoutout to all the contributors who have dedicated their time and expertise to make this project a reality. :sparkles: Your efforts are highly appreciated!
