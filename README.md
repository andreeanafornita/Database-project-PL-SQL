# 🎓 DATABASE PROJECT - UNIVERSITIES 🏫


Welcome to the Universities Database Project! 🎉

## Project Overview 📚

The aim of this project is to design a comprehensive database within the SQL Oracle Developer platform, specially tailored for managing diverse data related to different universities in Bucharest. This project incorporates distinct tables that have been carefully structured to highlight the intricate relationships between institutions, employees, and students. With the power of this database, we will be able to discern which universities are sponsored by prominent entities like Vodafone, Orange, and Accenture. Additionally, the database will provide in-depth insights into various students and their respective teachers.

## Main Tables 🗄️

To ensure clarity and effectiveness, this project encompasses 5 main tables:
- Sponsors
- Teachers
- Universities
- Gradebook
- Students

These tables form the foundation of our database, capturing vital information pertaining to universities and their academic ecosystem. 📊

## Complex Relationships 🔗

Given the prevalence of "many-to-many" relationships, I have introduced intermediary tables that bridge multiple primary tables. These intermediary tables serve as vital connectors and are named as a combination of the two tables they relate to. This design simplifies their recognition and utility. 💡

## Key Topics Covered 🚀

In this project, we delve into various aspects of working with Oracle server through SQL commands (LDD and LMD). We cover topics such as alternate and repetitive structures, data collections, exception handling, cursor management, functions, procedures, and triggers. 📋

## Getting Started 🛠️

1. **Clone the Repository**: Start by cloning this repository to your local machine.
2. **Configure Database Environment**: Set up your SQL Oracle Developer environment to interact with the database.
3. **Explore the Tables**: Dive into the distinct tables and relationships for a comprehensive understanding.
4. **Discover Insights**: Query and explore the database to extract valuable insights about universities and their dynamics.
